Ahoy!  
My name is Bernardas Ali≈°auskas and I am a Lithuanian currently living in Estonia, Tartu.   
I love programming, free software and bunch of other related things.  
I work a lot with python and it is my preferred programming language. Other than that I indulge in variety of other hobbies like photography, music(guitar, harmonica), video-games and pretty much a bunch of other related activities.

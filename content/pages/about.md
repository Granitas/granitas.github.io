Ahoy!  
My name is Bernardas Ali≈°auskas and I am a Lithuanian living in Estonia, Tartu, who loves programming, free software and bunch of other related things. 
Currently I'm a python developer over at [Scrapinghub](http://scrapinghub.com) and to put it briefly - I make web-crawlers and tools required to make those crawlers.  
Other than that I indulge in variety of other hobbies, starting from keeping pet rats to playing metal guitar \m/.

If you care about any of the above and end up being in Tartu, Estonia feel free to hit me up for some drinks and board games!

Slug: about

Ahoy, my name is Bernardas Ali≈°auskas and I go under the nickname Granitosaurus. 
Currently I'm a python developer over at [Scrapinghub](http://scrapinghub.com). 
Other than that I play guitar, video-games and have a bunch of rats.
I like free software and self-education. This blog covers a bit of everything from above.

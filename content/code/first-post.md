Summary: Starting up the blog with Python and Pelican static blog generator!

I've decided to start a blog after Python package called Pelican caught my eye.
### Installing Pelican
![Pelicans are cool]({filename}/images/pelican-bird.jpg)  
The setup for `Pelican` is pretty straightforward just run:
```bash
~> pip install pelican  # Installing Pelican package for python
~> mdir blog && cd blog  # Create and jump into your blog directory!
~/blog/> pelican-quickstart
	... #answer some simple questions here
~/blog/> vim content/first-page.md
	... #write your blog here in simple markdown
~/blog/> pelican content  # regenerate website
~/blog/> cd output
~/blog/output> python -m pelican.server  # run pelican server to test locally
```
Now connect to `http://localhost:8000` and there you go!  
You can check [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#articles-and-pages) for how to template your message how to format your blog entry.
### Vim markdown highlight for .md files
While going through the installation I've noticed that markdown doesn't have highlighting in vim which was peculiar. I found [this post which describes a simple fix](http://superuser.com/questions/701496/no-syntax-highlight-on-md-files).  
Simply create directories and file: 
```
~/.vim/ftdetect/markdown.vim
``` 
with content: 
```
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.md  setf markdown
```

### Theming Pelican
The default Pelican theme is pretty great however I stumbled on [flex-theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) on [pelican theme repo](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) on github. So that's my choice for now, but I'd like to touch up the color scheme a bit. Check out [`pelican-themes`](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/pelican-themes.html).
### Configuring Pelican
A lot of bells and whistles come straight out of the box with the pelican and your theme. For example to setup Disqus commnets all I had to do is add `DISQUS_SITENAME = "granitosaurus"` where `granitosaurus` is my registered name of my disqus account.
### Publishing Pelican 
Since Pelican generates a static webpage you can use anything to publish it. I decided to use [github user pages](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/tips.html#user-pages) which is a bit more complicated than the docs make it out to be. For user pages I like to keep the whole source code in branch `source` and keep the generated output in `master` as per github's user pages rule. Then use `ghp-import` to automatically update master code with the most recent  

    $ git checkout -b source
    $ pelican -o output -c publishconf.py
    $ ghp-import output -b master -p

The above will make source branch, generate blog and push the output to `master` so it's viewable at https://username.github.io 

**NOTE** The most important bit is to set `SITEURL` in your `publishconf.py` to `https://username.github.io` make sure it's **HTTPS** since default SITEURL generated by pelican is http and github pages requires https. This took me an hour of messing around to finally figure out.

### Wrap Up
So far Pelican took quite a bit of work to get things going. It looks quite simple but there's a bunch of little quirks that are really hard to debug. It's not as easy as starting up a wordpress blog but it's quite fun and it seems to be really flexible.   
Let's see if it pays off!

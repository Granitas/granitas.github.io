Summary: Me and my girlfriend's struggle to get to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Status: Draft

Ho Chi Minh City - previously known as Saigon and renamed after communist revolution leader of vietnam after great reunification of South and North Vietnam.
Both names are very much accepted, interchangable and there doesn't seem to be any political tension regarding the name. In fact there's very little political tension regarding anything in general.

# Weather

We arrived at HCMC in late November, just 10 hours ago we were in snowy cold Helsinki and now we stepped out of the airport and instantly felt the heat and humidity of south vietnamese weather.
It was really humid. I've tried to research statistics for the blog but I felt that the numbers just failed to represent how it actually feels - so you'll just have to take my word for it on this one.

Temperature in Ho Chi Minh City (and sounds Vietnam in general) is very much the same all year round,
however some days are very humid, making sweat hard to evaporate thus making you feel
that it's significantly hotter than it actually is.
Most of the inside places are running heavy air conditioning so it was pretty funny to see people
wearing hats and winter jackets when it's 30Â° outside.
Movie theaters in particular are chilly, so packing a hoodie is vital!

Regarding rain - Saigon has two seasons: wet and dry. We arrived at the end of November when
wet season was at the very end thus we haven't encountered much rain. There were few "flash pours"
when there was big bursts of rain coming down for few minutes but it was really rare.

Saigon in general was pretty foggy and overcast most of the time, except for early morning where occasionally you could get a real sun-burn!

### Air Quality

If you've seen and/or been in Asia you're probably familiar with the smog, dust and facemasks people wear.
Saigon being a huge ass city that is still under heavily development is no exception. It's smoggy, dusty and humid - but for some reason it feels ok. I don't particularly have a sensitive nose but my acne wasn't too happy about the the sudden changes!

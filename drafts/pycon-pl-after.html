    <p>Last year in Euro-Python 2015 someone from PyconPL had a lightning talk about PyconPL and since that moment I was sold. However I missed it by few days. This year I made it and as a bonus I checked out Warsaw, Poland too!</p>
<p>You can check my previous blog post how we got to Warsaw: me</p>
<p>Before going to Pycon me and my girlfriend took two days to look around Warsaw, Poland. Throughout the trip we stayed in 3 airbnb places that I will tell more about later on. The first day we were really surprised how pretty and populated Warsaw is. To give a little background, before the trip we did a bunch of research of what to do in Warsaw and we really didn't find much and we didn't really have high hopes to begin with, thus the surprise.  </p>
<h2>Food and Prices</h2>
<p>The city is beautiful and there are so many food places. The first thing we did was go to <a href="#TODO">Mango Vegan Street Food</a> which serves great hummus as well as other vegan dishes at a surprisingly low price. Low price is definitely a recurring theme in Warsaw - everything is surprisingly cheaper than in Estonia or Lithuania.<br />
I've heard of a saying: "Poland is an eastern-european country with western-european prices" which I heavily disagree with, unless western-europe is cheaper than eastern. Everything in general is at least 20% cheaper than in Estonia, sometimes significantly more and matching quality!<br />
As a vegetarian I was surprised by how <strong>many vegetarian places</strong> and options there are in Warsaw. The vegan trend definitely feels real, which is was both a pleasant surprise and a piece of convenience. <br />
For vegetarianism itself - I found that a lot of polish people do not consider fish as meat, which is extremely weird and nonsensical. I've noticed that it's quite common misunderstanding across the europe, had a very similar thing happen in Spain at Europython 2015 when the vegetarian sandwich I ordered in fact, was a tuna sandwich...</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Simple Definition of meat</dt>
<dd>the flesh of an animal used as food</dd>
<dd>a type of meat</dd>
<dd>the part of something (such as a nut) that can be eaten</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Also worth noting that a <strong>vegetarian person who eats fish is actually called pescatarian</strong>. It's a rather peculiar sounding term but it's there for a reason - fish is meat.</p>
<h3>Few Cool Places</h3>
<h4><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274856-d8529497-Reviews-Mango_Vegan_Street_Food-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html">Mango Vegan Street Food</a></h4>
<p><img alt="mango vegan street food" src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/c0/d2/6d/mango-vegan-street-food.jpg" />
As I've mentioned above the place is great. It's quite cheap and the food is great. You can get daily deals (that last whole day) and some weekdays have discounts on some dishes. The food selection isn't great, mostly it's just flavours and variants of few dishes, but it's enough for few visits a week.<br />
Personal favourite: Pomegranate Hummus!  </p>
<h4><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274856-d7189289-Reviews-Bubbleology-Warsaw_Mazovia_Province_Central_Poland.html">Bubbleology</a></h4>
<p><img alt="bubbleology" src="#TODO" title="Helen's instagram photo" /><br />
Bubble tea used to be a pretty huge fad across the whole europe few years ago. However these days it's no longer even a thing in Estonia or Lithuania. Bubble tea is pretty much a tea drink with syrup-like bubbles that you can suck in using bigger than usual straw together with your tea, it's a mix of a dessert and a drink.<br />
There's nothing particularity interesting about this shop other than it's themed as a science lab where bubble tea science happens.<br />
Regarding the prices - they are somewhat steeper than you'd expect even when Bubble tea in general is considered to be more expensive than it should.</p>
<h4><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mins-onigiri-warszawa?osq=onigiri">Min's Onigiri</a></h4>
<p><img alt="min's onigiri place" src="#TODO" title="Helen's instragram photo" /><br />
Onigiri is a Japanese rice ball that can have some flavours in the middle as well as be covered in some dry seaweed. I really enjoyed this place, it only serves around 8 kinds of different rice balls and some miso soup. The onigiri themselves aren't that big so you most likely want to take several. All that being said they are delicious and miso + onigiri combo ended up being a perfect autumn food!<br />
Regarding the prices - it's really reasonable. One rice ball + miso soup ended up being 10 PLN (2.3 euros) and 7 without the soup.</p>
